Person Re-identification

Abstract
Deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become very popular for solving problems related to image recognition, image reconstruction, and various other computer vision problems. Libraries such TensorFlow* and Keras* make the programmer’s job easier. But, these libraries do not directly provide support for complex networks and uncommonly used layers. This guide will help you to write complex neural networks such as Siamese networks in Keras. It also explains the procedure to write your own custom layers in Keras.
